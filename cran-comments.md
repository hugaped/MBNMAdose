## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed the `This package` from the start of the DESCRIPTION
* Removed a URL that was causing problems in .Rd files
* Reduced time taken for examples to run


## Test environments

* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.2.4
* local Windows, R 3.6.1 (devel and release)
* Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran (on rhub)
* Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS, R-release, GCC (on rhub)
* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel, 32/64 bit (on rhub)
* Cannot test on macOS (on rhub or travis-ci) since requires system installation of JAGS (not available on CRAN)


## R CMD check results

There was 1 NOTE:
* New submission

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs

First submission of the package

R CMD check succeeded


## Downstream dependencies

There are no downstream dependencies (yet!)
