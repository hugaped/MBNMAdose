Description: This package fits Bayesian dose-response model-based network meta-analysis (MBNMA) 
  that incorporate multiple doses within an agent by modelling different dose-response functions. 
  By modelling dose-response relationships this can connect networks of evidence that might
  otherwise be disconnected, and can improve precision on treatment estimates. Several common 
  dose-response functions are provided; others may be added by the user. Various characteristics
  and assumptions can be flexibly added to the models, such as shared class effects. The consistency 
  of direct and indirect evidence in the network can be assessed using unrelated mean effects models 
  and/or by node-splitting at the treatment level.
