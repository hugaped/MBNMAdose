# MBNMAdose 0.4.1

The goal of `MBNMAdose` is to provide a collection of useful commands that allow users to run dose-response Model-Based Network Meta-Analyses (MBNMA). This allows evidence synthesis of studies that compare multiple doses
of different agents in a way that can account for the dose-response relationship.

Whilst making use of all the available evidence in a statistically robust and biologically plausible framework, this also can help connect networks at the agent level that may otherwise be disconnected at the dose/treatment level, and help improve precision of estimates[@pedder2021]. It avoids "lumping" of doses that is often done in standard Network Meta-Analysis (NMA). All models and analyses are implemented in a Bayesian framework, following an extension of the standard NMA methodology presented by [@lu2004] and are run in JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler). For full details of dose-response MBNMA methodology see Mawdsley et al. [-@mawdsley2016]. Throughout this package we refer to a **treatment** as a specific **dose** or a specific **agent**.

## Installation

On CRAN you can easily install the current release version of `MBNMAdose` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("MBNMAdose")
```


For the development version the package can be installed directly from GitHub using the `devtools` R package:

``` r
# First install devtools
install.packages("devtools")

# Then install MBNMAdose directly from GitHub
devtools::install_github("hugaped/MBNMAdose")
```


## Workflow

Functions within `MBNMAdose` follow a clear pattern of use:

1. Load your data into the correct format using `mbnma.network()`
2. Analyse your data using `mbnma.run()` with a wide range of dose-response functions
3. Examine model results using forest plots and treatment rankings
4. Check model fit and test for consistency using functions like `mbnma.nodesplit()`
5. Use your model to predict responses using `predict()`
6. Calculate relative effects between any doses (even those not in the original dataset) using `get.relative()`

At each of these stages there are a number of informative plots that can be generated to help understand the data and to make decisions regarding model fitting. Exported functions in the package are connected like so:
